<span class="s2">&quot;&quot;&quot;DEPRECATED:  Declares the RPC service interfaces. 
 
This module declares the abstract interfaces underlying proto2 RPC 
services.  These are intended to be independent of any particular RPC 
implementation, so that proto2 services can be used on top of a variety 
of implementations.  Starting with version 2.3.0, RPC implementations should 
not try to build on these, but should instead provide code generator plugins 
which generate code specific to the particular RPC implementation.  This way 
the generated code can be more appropriate for the implementation in use 
and can avoid unnecessary layers of indirection.

  <span class="s2">&quot;&quot;&quot;Abstract base interface for protocol-buffer-based RPC services. 
 
  Services themselves are abstract classes (implemented either by servers or as 
  stubs), but they subclass this base interface. The methods of this 
  interface can be used to call the methods of the service without knowing 
  its exact type at compile time (analogous to the Message interface).

    <span class="s2">&quot;&quot;&quot;Calls a method of the service specified by method_descriptor. 
 
    If &quot;done&quot; is None then the call is blocking and the response 
    message will be returned directly.  Otherwise the call is asynchronous 
    and &quot;done&quot; will later be called with the response value. 
 
    In the blocking case, RpcException will be raised on error. 
 
    Preconditions: 
 
    * method_descriptor.service == GetDescriptor 
    * request is of the exact same classes as returned by 
      GetRequestClass(method). 
    * After the call has started, the request must not be modified. 
    * &quot;rpc_controller&quot; is of the correct type for the RPC implementation being 
      used by this Service.  For stubs, the &quot;correct type&quot; depends on the 
      RpcChannel which the stub is using. 
 
    Postconditions: 
 
    * &quot;done&quot; will be called when the method is complete.  This may be 
      before CallMethod() returns or it may be at some point in the future. 
    * If the RPC failed, the response value passed to &quot;done&quot; will be None. 
      Further details about the failure can be found by querying the 
      RpcController.

    CallMethod() requires that the request is of a particular subclass of 
    Message. GetRequestClass() gets the default instance of this required 
    type. 
 
    Example: 
      method = service.GetDescriptor().FindMethodByName(&quot;Foo&quot;) 
      request = stub.GetRequestClass(method)() 
      request.ParseFromString(input) 
      service.CallMethod(method, request, callback)

    <span class="s2">&quot;&quot;&quot;Returns the class of the response message for the specified method. 
 
    This method isn't really needed, as the RpcChannel's CallMethod constructs 
    the response protocol message. It's provided anyway in case it is useful 
    for the caller to know the response type in advance.

  <span class="s2">&quot;&quot;&quot;An RpcController mediates a single method call. 
 
  The primary purpose of the controller is to provide a way to manipulate 
  settings specific to the RPC implementation and to find out about RPC-level 
  errors. The methods provided by the RpcController interface are intended 
  to be a &quot;least common denominator&quot; set of features which we expect all 
  implementations to support.  Specific implementations may provide more 
  advanced features (e.g. deadline propagation).

    After a call has finished, returns true if the call failed.  The possible 
    reasons for failure depend on the RPC implementation.  Failed() must not 
    be called before a call has finished.  If Failed() returns true, the 
    contents of the response message are undefined.

    Advises the RPC system that the caller desires that the RPC call be 
    canceled.  The RPC system may cancel it immediately, may wait awhile and 
    then cancel it, or may not even cancel the call at all.  If the call is 
    canceled, the &quot;done&quot; callback will still be called and the RpcController 
    will indicate that the call failed at that time.

    Causes Failed() to return true on the client side.  &quot;reason&quot; will be

    Asks that the given callback be called when the RPC is canceled.  The

  <span class="s2">&quot;&quot;&quot;Abstract interface for an RPC channel. 
 
  An RpcChannel represents a communication line to a service which can be used 
  to call that service's methods.  The service may be running on another 
  machine. Normally, you should not use an RpcChannel directly, but instead 
  construct a stub {@link Service} wrapping it.  Example: 
 
  Example: 
    RpcChannel channel = rpcImpl.Channel(&quot;remotehost.example.com:1234&quot;) 
    RpcController controller = rpcImpl.Controller() 
    MyService service = MyService_Stub(channel)

    <span class="s2">&quot;&quot;&quot;Calls the method identified by the descriptor. 
 
    Call the given method of the remote service.  The signature of this 
    procedure looks the same as Service.CallMethod(), but the requirements 
    are less strict in one important way:  the request object doesn't have to 
    be of any specific class as long as its descriptor is method.input_type.
