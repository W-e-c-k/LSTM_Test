<span class="s0">class </span><span class="s1">Callback</span><span class="s2">:</span>
    <span class="s4">&quot;&quot;&quot;Base class used to build new callbacks. 
 
    Callbacks can be passed to keras methods such as `fit()`, `evaluate()`, and 
    `predict()` in order to hook into the various stages of the model training, 
    evaluation, and inference lifecycle. 
 
    To create a custom callback, subclass `keras.callbacks.Callback` and 
    override the method associated with the stage of interest. 
 
    Example: 
 
    &gt;&gt;&gt; training_finished = False 
    &gt;&gt;&gt; class MyCallback(Callback): 
    ...   def on_train_end(self, logs=None): 
    ...     global training_finished 
    ...     training_finished = True 
    &gt;&gt;&gt; model = Sequential([ 
    ...     layers.Dense(1, input_shape=(1,))]) 
    &gt;&gt;&gt; model.compile(loss='mean_squared_error') 
    &gt;&gt;&gt; model.fit(np.array([[1.0]]), np.array([[1.0]]), 
    ...           callbacks=[MyCallback()]) 
    &gt;&gt;&gt; assert training_finished == True 
 
    If you want to use `Callback` objects in a custom training loop: 
 
    1. You should pack all your callbacks into a single `callbacks.CallbackList` 
       so they can all be called together. 
    2. You will need to manually call all the `on_*` methods at the appropriate 
       locations in your loop. Like this: 
 
    Example: 
 
    ```python 
    callbacks =  keras.callbacks.CallbackList([...]) 
    callbacks.append(...) 
    callbacks.on_train_begin(...) 
    for epoch in range(EPOCHS): 
        callbacks.on_epoch_begin(epoch) 
        for i, data in dataset.enumerate(): 
        callbacks.on_train_batch_begin(i) 
        batch_logs = model.train_step(data) 
        callbacks.on_train_batch_end(i, batch_logs) 
        epoch_logs = ... 
        callbacks.on_epoch_end(epoch, epoch_logs) 
    final_logs=... 
    callbacks.on_train_end(final_logs) 
    ``` 
 
    Attributes: 
        params: Dict. Training parameters 
            (eg. verbosity, batch size, number of epochs...). 
        model: Instance of `Model`. 
            Reference of the model being trained. 
 
    The `logs` dictionary that callback methods 
    take as argument will contain keys for quantities relevant to 
    the current batch or epoch (see method-specific docstrings).
