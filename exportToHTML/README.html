<span class="s0">&quot;&quot;&quot;</span>
<span class="s0">L-BFGS-B is a limited-memory quasi-Newton code for bound-constrained</span>
<span class="s0">optimization, i.e. for problems where the only constraints are of the</span>
<span class="s0">form l&lt;= x &lt;= u.</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;&quot;&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">This is a Python wrapper (using F2PY) written by David M. Cooke</span>
<span class="s0">&lt;cookedm@physics.mcmaster.ca&gt; and released as version 0.9 on April 9, 2004.</span>
<span class="s0">The wrapper was slightly modified by Joonas Paalasmaa for the 3.0 version</span>
<span class="s0">in March 2012.</span>

<span class="s0">The Python wrapper</span>
<span class="s0">==================</span>

<span class="s0">This code uses F2PY (http://cens.ioc.ee/projects/f2py2e/) to generate</span>
<span class="s0">the wrapper around the Fortran code.</span>

<span class="s0">The Python code and wrapper are copyrighted 2004 by David M. Cooke</span>
<span class="s0">&lt;cookedm@physics.mcmaster.ca&gt;.</span>

<span class="s0">Example usage</span>
<span class="s0">=============</span>

<span class="s0">An example of the usage is given at the bottom of the lbfgsb.py file.</span>
<span class="s0">Run it with 'python lbfgsb.py'.</span>
