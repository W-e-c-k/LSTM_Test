        method. 
 
        This method may be called at any time and is idempotent. Passing a smaller

          grace: A duration of time in seconds to allow existing RPCs to complete

            immediate abortion of all in-progress RPCs.

          A threading.Event that will be set when this Server has completely 
          stopped. The returned event may not be set until after the full grace 
          period (if some ongoing RPC continues for the full length of the period) 
          of it may be set much sooner (such as if this Server had no RPCs underway 
          at the time it was stopped or if all RPCs that it had underway completed 
          very early in the grace period).
